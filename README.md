This project is an RFID reader system using an **ESP32 WROOM 32D**, a **20x4 I2C LCD**, a **switch button**, a **buzzer for sound feedback**, and an **RDM6300 RFID Reader (125kHz)**. It utilizes the **LiquidCrystal_I2C** library for LCD control and is developed using **VSCode with PlatformIO**. The RFID reader scans **4-byte UID values** in both **decimal and hexadecimal formats**, allowing identification of different RFID tags. The scanned UID is processed to determine access permissions (allowed/denied) or to generate a unique sound feedback using the buzzer.

## Features
- Displays system status on an I2C LCD.
- Switch button to toggle ON/OFF state.
- Boot animation with a progress bar effect for better user experience.
- Serial output for debugging.
- Reads RFID UIDs in both decimal and hexadecimal formats.
- Prevents duplicate readings within a configurable timeout period (`RFID_READ_TIMEOUT`, default: 2000 ms).
- Buzzer feedback with different melodies for accepted, denied, and custom RFID tags.
- WiFi connectivity to enable network-based functionalities (e.g., sending scanned UID to a server).
- Uses a **`secrets.h` file** for storing sensitive credentials (WiFi SSID & password).

## Components
- ESP32 WROOM 32D
- 20x4 I2C LCD
- Switch (ON/OFF button)
- RDM6300 RFID Reader (125kHz)
- Buzzer (PWM-controlled)

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **VSCode with PlatformIO** - Used as the development environment.
- **Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Driver** - Required for serial communication with ESP32.  
  [Download the driver here](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads).
- **Git** - To clone the repository.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ridwanpranata/esp32-rfid-reader.git
   cd esp32-rfid-reader
   ```
2. **Copy `secrets.example.h` file in the `include/` directory to `include/secrets.h`**
   ```sh
   cp include/secrets.example.h include/secrets.h
   ```
   **Note:** Do not commit `secrets.h` to GitHub. Add it to `.gitignore`.
3. **Open in VSCode with PlatformIO**
4. **Install dependencies** (Ensure you have the required library)
   ```sh
   pio lib install "marcoschwartz/LiquidCrystal_I2C@^1.1.4"
   ```
5. **Connect ESP32 to your PC**
6. **Upload the code**
   ```sh
   pio run --target upload
   ```
7. **Monitor Serial Output**
   ```sh
   pio device monitor --baud 115200
   ```

## Wiring
### LCD Wiring
| ESP32 Pin | LCD Pin  |
|-----------|---------|
| 21 (SDA)  | SDA     |
| 22 (SCL)  | SCL     |
| GND       | GND     |
| 5V        | VCC     |

### Switch Wiring
| ESP32 Pin | Switch Pin |
|-----------|------------|
| 12        | One side   |
| GND       | Other side |

### RFID Reader Wiring
| ESP32 Pin | RFID Reader Pin |
|-----------|----------------|
| 16        | TX             |
| GND       | GND            |
| 3.3V      | VCC            |

### Buzzer Wiring
| ESP32 Pin | Buzzer Pin |
|-----------|------------|
| 5         | Buzzer     |
| GND       | GND        |

## How It Works
### 1. System Initialization
- The system initializes the LCD and displays a **boot animation**.

### 2. RFID Scanning & UID Processing
- The switch button toggles the system state **ON/OFF**.
- The LCD displays the updated status dynamically.
- The RFID reader continuously listens for a tag scan.
- If an RFID tag is detected:
  - The UID is displayed in decimal format on the LCD.
  - The Serial Monitor outputs show the UID in both decimal and hexadecimal formats.
  - A melody plays on the buzzer based on the tag's UID.
  - Specific UIDs have predefined sounds (allowed/denied sounds).
  - Other UIDs generate a melody based on their last four digits.

### 3. Duplicate RFID Prevention
- Duplicate RFID tags are ignored within a configurable timeout period (`RFID_READ_TIMEOUT`).

### 4. WiFi Connectivity & IP Usage
- The system connects to WiFi using credentials from `secrets.h`.
- If successful, the **IP address** is displayed in the Serial Monitor.
- This WiFi connection can be used for future network-related functionalities such as **sending scanned UID data to a server**.

## WiFi Integration
- The ESP32 will attempt to connect to WiFi at startup using credentials stored in `secrets.h`.
- If WiFi is unavailable, the system will run in **offline mode**.

## Sound Feedback
| RFID UID         | Buzzer Sound |
|------------------|--------------|
| RFID_ALLOWED_UID | "Allowed" melody |
| RFID_DENIED_UID  | "Denied" melody |
| Other UIDs       | Custom melody based on last 4 digits |

## Serial Monitor Output Example
```
System ON
Connecting to WiFi...
WiFi connected!
IP Address: 192.168.1.100
System initialized. Waiting for RFID...
RFID UID Decimal (4 Byte): 0012345678
RFID UID Hexadecimal: 12AB34CD
Playing melody for UID last 4 digits: 5678
